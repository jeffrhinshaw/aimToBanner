-- Requirements. SR 43639--
---------------------------
The CC Accessibility team would like Banner to update nightly and reflect disabiity status as reflected in the AIMS system

1) Sara R. will update SATURN.STVDISA to have disibility codes and descriptions as needed
	- The code will exactly match the code as in AIMS
	- Sara will have to abbreviate the description since banner has a smaller field to store this than does the AIMS system
2) New nightly job will pull the current disability information from AIMS
	a) Student id
	b) Student disability description (2 character numeric)
	c) Note, a student may have more than one disability
	d) The disability info will populate SATURN.SGRDISA (sgadisa form)
		a) For the student, current term, and disability
    	b) should have at 7:00pm daily. we should have access to sftp server.
3) When there is an error processing the file, an email will be sent to sara
	- if the disability code is not in SATURN.STVDISA
	- if the student id is not found

-- Outstanding Issues
  -- sara needs to enter codes
  -- sara needs to confirm she can see the AIMS codes
  -- would be nice to get an email distro to use, instead of saras email

	- Run new proc SZPDISA to read file and populate db
	- Email on error

Proc: BANINST1.SZPDISA
